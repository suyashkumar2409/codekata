# What’s a Code Kata?

As a group, software developers don’t practice enough. Most of our learning takes place on the job, which means that most of our mistakes get made there as well. Other creative professions practice: artists carry a sketchpad, musicians play technical pieces, poets constantly rewrite works. In karate, where the aim is to learn to spar or fight, most of a student’s time is spent learning and refining basic moves. The more formal of these exercises are called kata.

To help developers get the same benefits from practicing, we’re putting together a series of code kata: simple, artificial exercises which let us experiment and learn without the pressure of a production environment. Our suggestions for doing the kata are:

find a place and time where you won’t be interrupted
focus on the essential elements of the kata
remember to look for feedback for every major decision
if it helps, keep a journal of your progress
have discussion groups with other developers, but try to have completed the kata first
There are no right or wrong answers in these kata: the benefit comes from the process, not from the result.
